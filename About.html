 <p style="padding-top: 15px">After gaining the "SLC School Topper" title from my school, I quickly 
 realized that only gaining an academic excellence is not enough to fulfill my dream and to reach 
 pinnacle. From that point, I have been working on myself by taking practical knowledge along academy 
 and have been asking myself in every step, "what have I learned from this?". During my journey to 
 Bachelor of Industrial Engineering, I came across Operational Research and fell in love with it. 
 Operational Research was so much interesting that, I felt I could live with it for the rest of my life.
